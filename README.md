# World-runner
 side scroller endless runner
 
 No serious issues.
 Sometimes endless runners can be stress inducing, so that is why I made a one way, safe and relaxing game. You can still die, but it is harder than some other types of endless runners.
 In this project I worked more on understanding procedural world generation, and object pooling.
 
 hold down the left arrow key or "D" to move, press space to jump, and esc to pause.
 you can stop, and you have 3 lives, but the falling lava rocks will hit you if you stand still for too long (1 rock = 1 life gone)
 hearts will replenish your lives, but it is capped at 3 hearts if you collect a heart while at full health it will count as 10 diamonds.
 The diamonds are your "coins" and count towards your high score (along with the distance you have made it)
 The coin with a red and black "S" on it will make you a super player, while the timer last you will move faster, jump higher, and be invincible.
 The weight item will slow you down while the timer is active.
 The bouncy guys with spikes will hurt you, so will the lava, and the falling "lava rocks."
